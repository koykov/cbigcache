#CBigCache

Fast in-memory cache. Inspired by [bigcache](https://github.com/allegro/bigcache) but have the difference - all
allocations performs in C memory, so that it has zero allocations during the work.

Caution! This is an experimental project and made just for fun and improve C++ skills.

I'm pretty sure it will never use in production.
